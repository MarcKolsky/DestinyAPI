# DestinyAPI

This is a script to utilize the Destiny APIs to retrieve data from the Iron Banner event.  Once a month in Destiny 1, Bungie would hold a special player vs player event called Iron Banner.  Inside Destiny 1 you had groups called "clans", and a clan could track which of its members were the best in each month's Iron Banner.

With this script was written for a specific clan I am in, and used it to retrieve the results for a specific period of time.  These results were then uploaded into a table on a SQL Server.  Finally the results were filtered and exported into various categories to be uploaded to a forum for the clan to see.
